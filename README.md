**Project 2:                 Implicit intents-bitmap manipulation-libraries**

**Overall Description**

Please develop an application that can take a picture using the device camera, turn it into a Black and White sketch, colorize it, and share this image  with others.  On startup your GUI will look similar to the following.  (Note that the image goes from edge to edge)
![Alt text](./ART/1.png?raw=true "Figure 1")
**What I have provided**

- A starter project (P2_skel.zip) with;
  - A module library (bitmap\_utilities) contains
    - Bitmap\_Helpers – A wrapper class exposing image manipulation routines you will need for this project
    - Other imaging processing static functions
  - A module Project2\_Solution\_Color which is where you will do most of your work.
  - This is also the module that you run the project from

**Things I will look for;**

1. Correctly and completely implementing project flow
2. Using the module library project I gave you as a library, please do not copy the bits you need into your project.
3. Correctly implemented AppBar
4. Getting the UI correct, this means
  - Correctly generated and displayed Black and White sketch
  - Correctly generated and displayed Color sketch
  - Correctly share a picture, Your app must append a subject, some default text and the image generated above automatically to the message.  This means the user should not have to hunt for it in the messaging application.
5. Correctly implemented settings
6. When you install the app it will show a default image that you have in res\drawable
7. If you have taken a picture with the app or processed it using the sketch or colorize button then when you start the app the next time this should be th image it shows you
8. When you hit the reset button the app will again show the default image (see 5)



**Project Hints**

**In general use the classes I gave you especially Camera\_Helpers and BitMap\_Helpers.  **

**Set your camera on the lowest resolution possible to minimize waiting.**

**Layout**

I used an imageview for the background image

**Default Images**

Place  in the res/drawable folder.  Mine is a PNG file.  This image will be part of your final APK. The default image can be set in XML using;

android:src=

android:scaleType=_&quot;fitXY&quot;_

You will eventually need to figure out what your screen dimensions are.  The following code will give you this;

**Permissions**

You are using the camera and the file system which will probably violate Android OS security checks.  Make sure you set proper permissions in your manifest.  Special problems arise if you are targeting a device running Android 6.0.  See the following;

http://www.captechconsulting.com/blogs/runtime-permissions-best-practices-and-how-to-gracefully-handle-permission-removal



**Locking Orientation**

Usually the only time you want to lock orientation is when you are writing a game, where the phone needs to stay in landscape while you plink away at targets.  For this app however, I am only going to test in portrait mode. In the real world, phones with slider keyboards would have a problem with this as keyboards are used in landscape mode.  If your app is locked in portrait then it will appear sideways on the screen.   Use the following code in your manifest for the activity to lock your app into portrait mode if you wish.

android:screenOrientation=&quot;portrait&quot;

**Emulator Shortcomings**

Here is where the emulator is awful.  Most are incapable of using the webcam on your development machine. It will however &#39;emulate&#39; a camera.But it will be easier to develop this project on a physical device.

**AppBar (also known as toolbar)**

  You have to set up an AppBar like this for this project.  See lecture notes and the following links;

**Reset**

Delete any images that may be in the devices external storage (use Camera\_Helpers).  Then reset the image showing with something similar to;

**myImage**.setImageResource(R.drawable. **gutters** );
**myImage**.setScaleType(ImageView.ScaleType.**FIT\_CENTER)**;

**myImage**.setScaleType(ImageView.ScaleType. **FIT\_XY** );



**Picture Help**

Before invoking the camera app to take a picture, you may pass an extra EXTRA\_OUTPUT to control where this image will be written. If the EXTRA\_OUTPUT is not present, then a small sized image is returned as a Bitmap object in the data field of onActivityResult. This is useful for applications that only need a small image. If the EXTRA\_OUTPUT is present, then the full-sized image will be written to the Uri value of EXTRA\_OUTPUT.

You will need an intent to start the camera app, here is mine;

Intent intent = **new** Intent(MediaStore._ACTION\_IMAGE\_CAPTURE_);

You will need to specify a storage location for the camera app to put the picture

See Environment._getExternalStoragePublicDirectory then you will build a Uri from this location.  You then add the Uri to the previous intent with the putExtra syntax, here is mine;_

intent.putExtra(MediaStore._EXTRA\_OUTPUT_, outputFileUri);

Finaly, you will tell the system to start an app that is capable of taking a picture, here is how I did it;

                startActivityForResult(intent, _TAKE\_PICTURE_);

startActivityForResult will invoke your devices picture taking application.  The &#39;ForResult&#39; portion means your activity wants the result of the cameras efforts. This comes your way via

@Override

**protected**** void**onActivityResult(**int **requestCode,** int** resultCode, Intent data)

The first parameter should be _TAKE\_PICTURE  _the second will be either _RESULT\_OK_ or [RESULT\_CANCELED](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html#RESULT_CANCELED).  Please handle appropriately.

**Scaling the image**

Please read the following article for help on this;

[http://developer.android.com/training/displaying-bitmaps/load-bitmap.html](http://developer.android.com/training/displaying-bitmaps/load-bitmap.html)

You must not waste resources.  This default image in the file should be scaled  to fit your intended  screen  resolution.  In fact most images you capture using the camera are going to have too high a resolution for your devices screen.

For example, the camera on the Galaxy Nexus takes photos up to 2592x1936 pixels (5 megapixels). If the bitmap configuration used is [**ARGB\_8888**](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Bitmap.Config.html) (the default from the Android 2.3 onward) then loading this image into memory takes about 19MB of memory (2592\*1936\*4 bytes).  But don&#39;t you lose resolution? No. The screen of a Galaxy Nexus had a density of 720×1280 (0.9 megapixels) anything higher is wasted.  So scale your photos.

I&#39;ve provided a static helper class that does all of this for you.  See:

Camera\_Helpers.loadAndScaleImage

**Make the image Sketchy**

I&#39;ve provided a library of bitmap image processing functions.  Some I found on the web, some I made.

This has been difficult for students in the past so I have created a wrapper class to do the hard work.  SeeBitMap\_Helpers. thresholdBmp

See the following link for Adobes description of the process

[http://www.createblog.com/paintshop-pro-tutorials/14018-sketch-effect/](http://www.createblog.com/paintshop-pro-tutorials/14018-sketch-effect/)

**Colorize the image**

To create a colorized image you must do several things:

1. Create a sketchy B/W image as above
2. Create a colorized image.  I&#39;ve create a helper function to ease this burden.  See BitMap\_Helpers.colorBmp
3. Add the images from 1 and 2 above.  I&#39;ve created another function to handle this as well. See BitMap\_Helpers.merge

**Invoking a communications app to send picture**

See [http://developer.android.com/training/sharing/send.html#send-text-content](http://developer.android.com/training/sharing/send.html#send-text-content) for an overview of the process.  Lots of ways to do this.  For me I got the path to the directory where my picture was stored, created a File from that path and my filename like so;

File file = **new** File(path, _PROCESSED\_FILE_);

Created a Uri from this file.  I then used the Uri to verify that the file existed, (if not the camera failed to save the picture).

I then created an Action\_Send implicit intent like so;

                intent.setAction(Intent._ACTION\_SEND_);

attached a bunch of extra information to it via putExtra (Subject, Text of message, File Uri etc) After that I started the activity.  I also included a chooser, which is a disambiguation dialog  that allows the user to choose an app to handle the request.   You will need to research this process as well.

**Customizing the image.  **

Select the &#39;Customize Image&#39; preference screen above to decide the percentage of sketchiness and saturation.  Two options:You can use 2 EditTextPreference&#39;s that only take numbers (not shown)

1. You can use the SeekBarPreference class from http://robobunny.com/wp/?p=190

If you do it this way I&#39;ll add 5% to your project grade.
